# Doubly Linked List Workshop

This workshop help me to understand the concept of Doubly Linked List and how to implement it in C programming language. The workshop is divided into several parts, each focusing on a different aspect of the Doubly Linked List data structure.

## Overview

A Doubly Linked List is a type of linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, each containing a reference (i.e., a link) to the next node and the previous node in the sequence.

## Program Description

This program provides a menu-driven interface to perform various operations on a doubly linked list. The operations include:

1. **Print the whole list**: This option allows you to print the entire list in either ascending or descending order.
2. **Add a new node at a position**: This option allows you to add a new node at a specific position in the list.
3. **Add a new node after a given id**: This option allows you to add a new node after a node with a specific id.
4. **Delete a node by position**: This option allows you to delete a node at a specific position.
5. **Delete a node after a given id**: This option allows you to delete a node that is located after a node with a specific id.
6. **Exit**: This option allows you to exit the program.

## How to Run

To run this program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use any C compiler of your choice. Once you have a C compiler installed, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the `main.c` file.
3. Compile the `main.c` file using the following command: `gcc main.c -o main`
4. Run the program using the following command: `./main`

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into several parts, each focusing on a different aspect of the Doubly Linked List data structure:

1. **Introduction to Doubly Linked Lists**: Understand the basic concept and structure of a Doubly Linked List.
2. **Node Creation**: Learn how to create a node in a Doubly Linked List.
3. **Adding Nodes**: Learn how to add nodes at specific positions or after a specific node in the list.
4. **Deleting Nodes**: Learn how to delete nodes from specific positions or after a specific node in the list.
5. **Printing the List**: Learn how to print the entire list in either ascending or descending order.
